NEW BRANCH - MODIFIED TO PROVOKE A CONFLICT, FIXED AFTERWARDS ----

I'm Chris, I'm from Swansea in the UK (currently based in Edinburgh) and I'm curently working for a bank. I have very little experience in data, and none in technology

I'm here to become better at data anlysis in my job, and learn skills beyond Excel, with the hope of moving into a more data-based role in the current company I work for.
